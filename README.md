Welcome to k53s, where we keep packing more and more functionality into a
starting k8s, until we end up with the biggest shortened name in the history
of abbreviated shortened names.

This repository is a holding place for a bunch of my Kubernetes and
Kubernetes-adjacent research.  Here you'll find incomprehensible notes,
undocumented YAML files, a Go operator or three, and more.
